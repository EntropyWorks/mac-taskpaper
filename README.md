## Some Background Thoughts

A long time ago, my task lists were held on simple .txt files or on .xls sheets for certain topics,
which also held some charts for progress and accomplishment analysis. I developed and followed my own and quite complex system, which included over 5 basic categories, narrowed down to up to 20 subcategories. It worked quite well and also included the Eisenhower principle, but then I met tux and later on mac os x and got tracked into editors and applications.

As a student obsessed with IT my GTD application journey started with a workshop at an IT conference at the summer of 2005. Although, software is not needed for managing tasks I got quite addicted to the search for the best tool and tested for a while nearly every task app since I had the first released smartphone with a touchscreen and later on a pocket pc.

I dived even deeper when I got the first iphone and the app store was launched. A bunch of apps were getting a lot of attention and I still have the full version for all of them. For a year I used things on mac, iphone (and switched even back to it when the ipad version was released).

Later on I used the hitlist, which was fantastic but laked mobile support. In the meantime I also worked with tiddlywikki, remember the milk, nozbe, taskpaper, helium task management, todo.txt, pocket informant, crosscheck, appagio todo, toodledo, wunderlist, Gqueues and a bunch of other tools, which are not noteworthy. I even discovered EasyTask Manager through a website which listed every management system and all availible apps for all popular plattforms with ratings. Hell, I even used the almighty omnifocus for a year.

But no system could have the same ease of use as plaintext files and manipulation via cli or a good editor like vim or emacs could offer. So I started using org mode and taskwarrior. 

As (1) the next platform (android) emerged, (2) I was dealing with enterprise ticket systems and enterprise task management applications and (3) minimalism started its triumphal procession in the blogging world it was clear that simple txt was the solution for all operating systems I use.

This is basically how I got back to using plaintext and taskpaper for improved aesthetics, the review-process and retrospectives.
(Even though I watched the live presentation of omnifocus 2 the day it was online I will not switch away from plaintext in the future.)

### Best Mac Applications

*If you still want to be should check out these apps*

- [Nozbe](http://www.nozbe.com/): Started out as a task management website for individuals and teams with deep integration to a lot of services (most popular today, evernote, google calender, dropbox) promoted by a very talented founder, blogger and screencaster and magazine creator. It has constantly grown and added an iphone app, added a mac app, added a windows app, added android support. Today it offers the most complete solution with the highest developmental progress over time.

- [Omnifocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/): Only shortcoming was the complex layout of filters in the mac app, but this will be fixed with the near arrival of version 2.

- [Things](http://culturedcode.com/things/): As they over-engineered their website design, blog posts and mainly the long announced and awaited push and cloud sync service the customer service in the forums went very low, diplomatically spoken. It was a very rough 3 year long developement phase but they finally delivered a perfect cloud sync system/framework, which Apple itself would probably have use/build (with a lot more resource power).

- [Organize](http://taskfabric.com/): Focuses on task visualization and rich interfaces but lacks really fitting application design.

### Honorable Mentions

* Tools with very good approaches but failed on the market *

- [The Hitlist](http://www.potionfactory.com/thehitlist/): Known for its flexible task presentation, time tracking and its once superior mac app design in comparison to things and omnifocus. Shortcomings: Sadly the indy developer couldn't deliver an iphone app at the right time to market - when a lot of nerds were asking, because of the mixed experiences with omnifocus and things.

- [Helium Task Management](http://www.heliumnow.com/) Known for its very good app design and email integration (similar to the new mail.app for iphone). Shortcomings: Maybe lack of investors. 

- [Easy Task Manager](http://www.orionbelt.com/): Known as the first system to offer support for all major plattforms. Shortcomings: Very basic and old school application design and limited features.
